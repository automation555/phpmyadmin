Create Own Custom Themes
========================

You can create your own themes using Theme Generator tool present on page index.php.
Choose a Base Colour using the colour picker tool.

Colour schemes
--------------

The colour schemes are:

* Triadic
* Complementary
* Adjacent
* Monochrome

You can choose any one of the four schemes using the dropdown menu.
Each element's colour can be customised by clicking on a particular colour box.
Upon hovering the colour box it would display the element the colour corresponds to.
On clicking Go button the program would create the necessary theme files.
Now you can choose the theme you created from the Theme drop-down on page index.php.

Automatic text colours for better visibility
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A checkbox can be found stating Automatically set text colours for best visibility.
On using this option the text colour would be chosen for best visibility.
You would not be able to change the text colours manually, when using this option.

Preview panels
++++++++++++++

On clicking Preview button the view would change to how the theme would look after
being saved. This is a temporary view and would not generate any files, and upon going on any
other page the view would return back to the original view. For better visualisation,
some elements such as tables and group would popup.

Saving the theme
++++++++++++++++

To save the theme, you need to specify a theme name. All other parameters are optional.
Note that if another theme already exists, it would be overwritten to save the new theme.
After the theme saved you can change the theme from the index.php page.
